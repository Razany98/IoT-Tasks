# Create and Control 

This repository is a simple guide for using and implementing codes on the ESP32 board.

One of the best features in ESP32 is the WiFi and Bluetooth integration in it which makes it more suitable for ioT projects, and in the wiki page you can see a long explanation on how to connect and control your board by your computer. 

### Lets Start!

- First thing you have to do is downloading the Arduino IDE software, it will make it easy to upload your code to the board. You can download it from here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software 

- After downloading you will get the main page:

- Then go to File and Preferences

- After that you will need to upload the board package. You can simply paste the following link to the place labeled below:
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

- For installing the board, go to tools, Arduino board, Board Manager, and look for the piece and install it as below :

- Once again, go to Arduino board from tools and choose 'WEMOS D1 MINI ESP32'.

- Then choose your port from tools (in our case it is COM3).
### SOOOOO, Here is the exciting Part! :)
In order to control your board programmatically, go to File - Example - Basic - Blink as follows:

A page with simple codes will open, and to control the blinking of the ESP32 you may play a little with the loop function code either to increase the delay or decrease it.

When you finish, press the uploading arrow on the above tool bar to send the commands to the board.

*Note: make sure you wiredly connected the board to the computer while you are working. :)

- This is the result when me and my team made the delay 100s:
